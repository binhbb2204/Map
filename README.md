## Description

This project provide a comparative analysis of two widely-used pathfinding algorithms, A* and Dijkstra’s, tested on mazes generated randomly and using the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. The primary objective is to identify the most effective algorithm for determining the shortest path between two points on a map, under various maze configurations and obstacle densities. Through a series of controlled experiments involving both random mazes and DFS-generated mazes with different cell sizes and obstacle percentages, A* consistently outperformed Dijkstra’s Algorithm. A*'s heuristic-driven approach significantly reduced the number of visited nodes, resulting in faster pathfinding, particularly in more complex and obstacle-rich environments. The results emphasise A*'s efficiency and suitability for real-time navigation applications. Future research will focus on optimising the memory usage of Dijkstra’s Algorithm and developing advanced pathfinding techniques incorporating machine learning to improve performance in dynamic and complex scenarios.
