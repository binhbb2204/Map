## Description

This project presents a comparative analysis of two widely-used pathfinding algorithms, A* and Dijkstra’s, evaluated on random mazes generated using the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. The main objective is to determine the most effective algorithm for finding the shortest path between two points on a map across various maze configurations and obstacle densities. Through a series of controlled experiments involving random mazes and DFS-generated mazes with different cell sizes and obstacle percentages, A* consistently outperformed Dijkstra’s Algorithm. A*'s heuristic-driven approach significantly reduced the number of visited nodes, resulting in faster pathfinding, particularly in complex and obstacle-rich environments.
The study highlights that both algorithms are effective when correctly implemented. The choice between them should be based on specific needs: A* is preferable if efficiency and a good heuristic are priorities, while Dijkstra’s algorithm is better suited for scenarios requiring guaranteed shortest paths despite higher computational costs.
Future research directions include optimizing Dijkstra’s Algorithm's memory usage and exploring advanced pathfinding techniques integrating machine learning to enhance performance in dynamic and complex scenarios.
