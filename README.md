## Description

This project explores integrating the A* algorithm and Dijkstra's Algorithm to enhance route planning and optimization in map navigation using the GraphHopper API. A* leverages heuristic functions for efficient pathfinding, while Dijkstra’s Algorithm ensures the shortest route by systematically exploring all nodes. By combining these methods, the project aims to overcome their individual limitations and improve overall performance and reliability. The research includes a comprehensive analysis and comparison of the algorithms’ efficiency, accuracy, and scalability, providing insights into their practical applications and potential improvements. Findings demonstrate the integrated approach's effectiveness in reliable navigation and suggest future enhancements like algorithm optimization, dynamic map adaptation, and user experience improvement.
